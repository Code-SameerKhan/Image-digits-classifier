# Image digits classifier
In this project using the support vector machine classifier, we classify digits in the load_digit dataset of sklearn.
Support vector machine is a type of classification machine learning algorithm in which a plane of segregation is created between the different target variables.

# Dataset

This is sklearn's digits dataset which consists of array of handwritten digits.
With the help of Matplotlib we can visualize the data

# Zero

# One

# Data in the form of an array

# Model building

Using Support Vector Machine we can classify the data and with the help of train and test split we can train the model to perform with a better accuracy

# Conclusion

We can come to conclusion that our our SVM model can predict with 97.77% accurately
